# My First Repo on Java Project

**Never Thought I would learn java**

because I thought java is for people with more grades and with more intelligence

But during the process of learning java I realized it is one of the beautiful language for a class of compiled languages

Me coming from a scripting language background, I can correlate and appreciate what scripting languages are good at and what are missing in scripting languages

Even the scripting languages I am using Node and Python, both being dynamically typed languages; I am always in a notion that learning strongly typed language will be a nightmare.

But I am wrong. So bless me for my java journey.
